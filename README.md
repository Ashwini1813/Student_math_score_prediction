Student Math Score Prediction Using Machine Learning

This AI/ML-based project predicts a student's math score based on input factors like gender, parental education, lunch type, and scores in reading and writing. It leverages the power of feature engineering, data preprocessing, and Linear Regression to build an effective and interpretable prediction model.

FEATURES :-

Reads student performance data from a CSV file

Applies feature engineering for better insights (e.g., average )

Uses ColumnTransformer, StandardScaler, and LabelEncoder

Trains a model using Linear Regression

Accepts custom user input and predicts the math score

Displays model accuracy using R² Score

TECHNOLOGIES USED :-

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy

HOW TO RUN :-

1. Clone the repository or download the code.

2. Ensure the following libraries are installed:
                                               pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
3. Run the Python file:
                       python student_score_predictor.py

4. Follow the terminal prompts to enter student details and get predicted math score.

DATASET :-

This project uses the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset from Kaggle.

Output Example

Model Accuracy (R² Score): 88.38%
Predicted Math Score: 72.5
